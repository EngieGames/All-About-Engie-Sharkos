- A new structure, which has a moderate chance to spawn.
- Armor to help you stay alive longer.
- **~~T H E M~~** *Ahem* Sorry about that, I meant to say Sharkos.

~~I also have no care if you just dip this, I just want to show off my modding skills.~~ <- **This is a joke by the way. I really do care if you download this.** Oh and I have been working on this since **2019**. I'm only deciding to upload this now.
